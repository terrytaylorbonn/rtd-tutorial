Shopping 
========

A really complex aspect of building a copter for newcomers is what to buy and how. ZiptieAI focuses on buying in the USA (getfpv.com, amazon.com, etc). In Ukraine it would be AliExpress.

Amazon
---------------

Amazon is (of course) the best for buy many things. What really makes it useful 

- Search engine
- Purchase history (this is something you will refer back to quite often while building a drone)


GetFPV.com
----------------

You can get many components (such as flight controller / ESC stacks) from this US-based supplier.


Aliexpress (and other Chinese suppliers)
----------------

I have never ordered from Chinese suppliers because of my concerns about payment info security. I have also heard that you can get good deals on Aliexpress, but you have to be careful about what you buy.
