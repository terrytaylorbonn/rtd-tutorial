ZiptieiAI Mission
-----------------

The ZiptieAI mission is to show how to get started with ziptie drones and AI (it not a product). 

Drone types
-----------

ZiptieAI focues on 2 main types of drones:

- FPV drones. These are the smaller drones that focus on "first person view" (FPV). They are typically used for racing, freestyle, and cinematic shots. 
- Autonomous drones. These are the larger drones that focus on autonomy. They are typically used for mapping, surveying, and other missions that require a lot of flight time and payload capacity. However, you can also use them for other missions, such as search and rescue, surveillance, and more.

AI
---

ZiptieAI focuses primarily on 

- Object recognition. This is the ability to recognize objects in the environment. This is useful for missions such as search and rescue, surveillance, and more.
- Object detection. This is the ability to detect objects in the environment. This is useful for missions such as obstacle avoidance, collision avoidance, and more.
- Path planning. This is the ability to plan a path for the drone to follow. This is useful for missions such as mapping, surveying, and more.
