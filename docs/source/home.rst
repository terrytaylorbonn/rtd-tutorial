This is the ZiptieAI.com docs website. 

ZiptieAI shows how to get started with ziptie drones and AI. Its not a product. A docs.{product}.com website is not really required (there is no installation, user manual, or API specifically for ZiptieAI). Therefore, this docs site is a simple overview of the ZiptieAI documentation processes.

uncontrollable; with AI it becomes autonomous).*
