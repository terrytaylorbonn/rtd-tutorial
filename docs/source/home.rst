*24.0226 UPDATE: Ordered yesterday from getfpv.com a Pixhawk 6c with
GPS. Should get it within a week. After I get it do HITL testing (part
3). Then order the frame and RC+battery. Meanwhile, working on Linux
certification.*

You can buy the latest drone or some AI-enabled product easily. But its
still quite a challenge to get started in development of AI or drones. I
got started with no assistance (it was not easy) thanks to a few good
tutorials (that were not easy to use) and stackoverflow.

I took a lot of good notes along the way. In early 2024 I decided to
create from my (extensive) notes what is basically a “Getting Started
with AI drones” program consisting of 2 components (*works in
progress*): - `This wiki <Wiki-organization>`__ that provides a very
organized big-picture conceptual intro to AI drones (something that I
have not seen elsewhere). I have probably made some mistakes, but with
time I will get everything right. - Step-by-step detailed
`documentation <https://github.com/terrytaylorbonn/auxdrone/wiki/Documentation>`__
on my public `Google
drive <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx_j_y0GJ6_RANR8Tjm>`__.

I still have lot to learn (and document along the way). Things are just
getting started!

and (right) the real (FPV) thing (if jammed, the FPV drone becomes
uncontrolled; with AI it becomes autonomous).*

*Note: This wiki will eventually be published
to*\ **ziptieai.com**\ *(url reserved already). The “Aux” in “Auxdrone”
comes from Auxiliumua.com, an NGO in Ukraine that really piqued my
interest in AI drones (I got acquainted with the company during a chance
meeting in Kyiv with one of their British consultants).*
