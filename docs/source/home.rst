This is the ZiptieAI.com docs website. *Note: I ran the wiki pages through a converter to rst format. Does not work too well, need to edit manually.*

You can buy the latest drone or some AI-enabled product easily. But its
still quite a challenge to get started in development of AI or drones. I
got started with no assistance (it was not easy) thanks to a few good
tutorials (that were not easy to use) and stackoverflow.


I still have lot to learn (and document along the way). Things are just
getting started!

uncontrolled; with AI it becomes autonomous).*
