Zip tie AI docs 
===============

This is the documentation website for the **Ziptie AI** drone project.

This site is a work in progress. As of 24.0503, the site basically mimics the structure and content of the wiki pages, but in an easier to read format. I will gradually fill this site with more detailed information gleaned from the docx's (word files) on my `Google drive <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx_j_y0GJ6_RANR8Tjm>`_.

.. Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information.

.. note This project is under active development.
