Zip tie AI docs 
===============

**24.1021 NOTE: docs.ziptieai.com is out-of-date and not being maintained.** docs.ziptieai.com is RTD/Sphinx; ziptieai.com is jekyll.

This is the documentation website for the **Ziptie AI** drone project.

Note that ZiptieAI is basically a DIY project (not a product). The docs describe how to use other products and tools. Therefore, this site does not have many of the typical product documentation sections (such as an API reference).

This site is a work in progress. As of 24.0503, the site basically mimics the structure and content of the `wiki pages <https://github.com/terrytaylorbonn/auxdrone/wiki/>`_ , but in an easier to read format. I will gradually fill this site with more detailed information gleaned from the docx's (word files) on my `Google drive <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx_j_y0GJ6_RANR8Tjm>`_.

.. Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information.

.. note This project is under active development.
